# Simple-Bot-Discord

To create this Discord bot, you must first have a Discord account. If you don't have a Discord account and a server where you are the server administrator, please create an account [Discord](https://discord).

## Creating a bot
After creating a Discord account, the next step is to create a bot, then set up access in the OAuth2 menu
- scope -> bot
- Text Permissions -> Send Messages

After that, copy the generated URL at the bottom and paste it into your web browser. A list of servers will appear where you are the administrator. Select one of the servers to add the bot.

After the bot has been successfully added, return to the bot menu and copy the token (to update the token, you can click Reset Token).
